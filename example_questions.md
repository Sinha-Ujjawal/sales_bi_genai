1. **Regional Product Performance Analysis**: Which product categories show consistent growth across all regions over the last 3 quarters, and which regions have the highest variance in category performance?

2. **Customer Lifetime Value by Region**: What is the average customer lifetime value (total purchases) across different regions, and how does the distribution of high-value customers (top 10%) vary by region?

3. **Seasonal Purchasing Patterns**: How do seasonal purchasing patterns differ between regions, and which product categories demonstrate the strongest seasonality effects?

4. **Customer Segment Migration**: What percentage of customers have shifted their purchasing behavior from one product category to another over the past year, and which categories show the highest customer retention?

5. **Regional Cross-Selling Opportunities**: Which product pairs are frequently purchased together in each region, and how can this information identify cross-selling opportunities in underperforming regions?

7. **Customer Acquisition Cohort Performance**: How do different customer acquisition cohorts (grouped by first purchase date) perform in terms of retention and revenue growth over time across regions?
