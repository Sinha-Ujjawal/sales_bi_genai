      "We need to produce planner notes pseudocode/planner notes before writing SQL. No actual SQL. Must not recommend any SQL functions. Just notes. Must consider ambiguous parts? The question: \"Which product pairs are frequently purchased together in each region, and how can this information identify cross-selling opportunities in underperforming regions?\" They define \"frequently purchased together\" as product pairs that are bought together in at least 3 sale_ids. They want median sales for finding underperforming regions: region is underperforming if below average of median sales of all regions. Do analysis for FY 2024 and FY 2025 separately. FY stands for full-year, not fiscal year. So we need to consider date ranges: FY 2024: 01-Jan-2024 to 31-Dec-2024. FY 2025: 01-Jan-2025 to 31-Dec-2025. But we only have data for 2024-2025?

They say \"median sales for finding the underperforming regions. A region is under performing if it is below average of median sales of all regions.\" So we need median sales per region: maybe median of total sales amount? But we don't have sales amount. We have transactions with units and product unit_price. So we can compute sales amount per sale: sum of units * unit_price.

Actually we refer to cnt in CASE expression: WHEN cnt % 2 = 1 THEN ... But cnt is not qualified; but we are in SELECT of median_region, which selects from region_sales rs. So cnt refers to rs.cnt.

      "1. **North Jonathan** – The sole frequent pair (*Harvey Ventures – Electricity* + *BLW Silver Sun Resorts – Bottle*) has a median of **$24,879**, well below the average. A bundled promotion could help lift the region’s performance.\n",
      "2. **South Michael** – The pair (*FRLX Holdings – Electricity* + *KKMX Mining – Furniture*) is frequent but underperforming. Cross‑sell this pair to increase transaction value.\n",
      "3. **Shanehaven** – Although not underperforming, the region has three frequent pairs with high medians (~$28,077). These pairs can serve as best‑practice examples for other regions.\n",

      "| 2024 | Lake Sheri | Yes | *Allied Mining – Glass* + *MBG Hotel – Bottle* | Bundle as “Hospitality Essentials” and offer a 10 % discount on combined purchase. |\n",
      "| 2024 | Port Rebecca | Yes | *Filipino Morning Enterprise – Bottle* + *SD Capital – Flour* | Create a “Breakfast Bundle” for retailers; promote via in‑store signage and email. |\n",
      "| 2024 | South Rachelburgh | Yes | *EZLJ City Sun Foods – Water* + *ZB Properties – Newspaper* | Cross‑sell to grocery chains; highlight convenience for commuters. |\n",
      "| 2024 | South Samanthafort | Yes | *Butler Union Empire – Bottle* + *IBM Manufacturing – Electricity* | Offer a “Home‑Energy Starter Pack” to residential customers. |\n",
      "| 2025 | North Jonathan | Yes | *Harvey Ventures – Electricity* + *BLW Silver Sun Resorts – Bottle* | Launch a “Vacation Power Pack” targeting travel agencies. |\n",

      "**Key Takeaway:**  \n",
      "By focusing on the most frequently purchased product pairs in under‑performing regions, we can design targeted bundle offers that leverage existing customer buying patterns. This strategy is expected to raise median sales toward the overall average, improve cross‑sell ratios, and ultimately strengthen revenue performance across all regions"
